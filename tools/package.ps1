# ASCII ONLY IN THIS FILE, deliberately. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less file as
# ANSI, so a UTF-8 em-dash decodes to a sequence ending in a curly quote - which 5.1 treats
# as a string delimiter and the whole script stops parsing. Cost one run to find.
#
# THE VERSION HAS ONE SOURCE: the csproj. The C# constant is already generated from it
# (see GenerateVersionConst), and this script WRITES manifest.json from it rather than
# comparing them. Ragnarok's Wrath checks that three copies agree and refuses when they do
# not, which is a good guard - but against a problem that need not exist. A number that is
# written cannot drift from itself.
#
# The built DLL is still checked against the csproj, because that catches the one thing
# generation cannot: packaging a stale binary from an earlier build.
